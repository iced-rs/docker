# iced-rs/docker
Docker images for building `iced` applications.

These images can be used together with [`cross`] for cross-compilation to different
targets (e.g. Raspberry Pi).

## GitHub Container Registry
The Docker images are readily available in [the GitHub Container Registry of the `iced-rs` organization](https://github.com/orgs/iced-rs/packages).

[`cross`]: https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross
